# Machine Learning Models

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Neural Network

1) Implemented 5-cross validation for all the above Machine Learning Models

2) Calculated Mean Absolute Percentage error (MAPE), accuracy, mean square error (), root mean square (RMS) for each of them and compared using MAPE 

3) Hyper-parameter tuning implemented for all models
