# Building a machine Learning model using lending club dataset
### Ten use cases and motivations for building a machine learning model using the Lending club database

### Part 1 : Our ficitional character- Tola the Investor (Risk taker)
    Research and summarize what your client’s needs are going to be
    Explore the data and comment on data quality, features and get a feel for the data. 
    For the purpose of this assignment, we will restrict the data to https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data. 

### Part 2: Data preparation 
    Data cleansing , Pre-processing , Feature Engineering 

### Part 3: Prediction
    Build 3 models : Regression , Random Forest, Neural Networks. 
    Use MAPE , Try 5-fold cross validation. 
    How does the model performance change

### Part 4 : Hyper Optimization
    Hyper parameter tunning :a. Regression: Try L1, L2, Elasticnet regularization. 
    b. Neural networks: Change epochs, optimizers, learning rate  
    c. Random forest: No of trees, Tree depth
    AutoML is a craze everyone is behind. Use a. TPOT,  b. AutSKLearn , c. H2o.ai . Discuss manual vs AutoML 

### Part 5 : Analysis
    Build out test cases to test out use cases that are important for your client. Run these tests and write a 1-page report to your client on why they should/shouldn’t use your model to predict interest rates and how they could use your model.
